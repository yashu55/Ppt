Here's an updated flow for your PowerPoint presentation, incorporating the "Own It, Win as One" value alignment and the additional information:


---

Slide 1: Title Slide

Title: Rule-Engine Based TMX API Mocking System Implementation

Subtitle: Achieving Operational Efficiency and Long-Term Cost Savings

Your Name & Role

Date



---

Slide 2: Problem Statement

Title: The Challenge

Bullet Points:

High volume of TMX API calls nearing contractual limits.

Potential for significant cost overage due to exceeding API usage caps.

The need to reduce reliance on vendor APIs in non-production environments.

Urgent solution required before the October 2024 contract deadline.




---

Slide 3: Why This Effort Was Necessary

Title: Why This Initiative Was Critical

Bullet Points:

Contract Overages: Imminent risk of surpassing the vendor's API usage cap.

Cost Management: The potential financial burden of exceeding contract limits.

Operational Streamlining: The goal to enhance system performance in lower environments.

Need for Urgency: Rapid solution implementation required to prevent contractual penalties.




---

Slide 4: Ownership and Collaboration

Title: Value Alignment: "Own It, Win as One"

Subheader: Exhibiting the Value in Implementation

Bullet Points:

Ownership: Full ownership of the PoC and full-scale implementation of the TMX API mocking system.

Delivered the solution within weeks to ensure compliance and cost savings.

Proactive risk management by preventing overage ahead of the October 2024 deadline.

Collaboration: Successful execution due to teamwork with cross-functional teams (engineering, vendor management, and operations).

Seamless integration of the rule engine into the existing environment, solving complex technical challenges together.




---

Slide 5: Solution Overview

Title: The TMX API Mocking System

Bullet Points:

Mocking TMX API Calls: Using a Rule-Engine based system to simulate TMX API responses in lower environments.

API Call Reduction: The rule engine determines when to mock API calls, reducing the reliance on actual TMX API usage.

Rapid Deployment: Implemented and deployed in lower environments in weeks, ahead of contract overage deadlines.




---

Slide 6: System Workflow (Diagram Slide)

Title: System Architecture and Workflow

Content:

Diagram: A flowchart showing how inputs flow through the rule engine, deciding whether to mock or make a real TMX API call.

Explanation:

The rule engine analyzes the API request, applies business logic, and determines if a mock response can be returned.

Only critical requests trigger actual TMX API calls, drastically reducing call volume.





---

Slide 7: Impact and Results

Title: Measurable Impact

Bullet Points:

API Call Reduction: Projected reduction of 2-3 million TMX API calls annually.

Cost Savings: Significant annual savings by preventing overages and reducing API usage.

Operational Efficiency: Reduced dependency on vendor APIs in lower environments, optimizing resource allocation.

Business Impact: Strengthened the company’s ability to control costs and maintain operational efficiency without compromising on functionality.




---

Slide 8: Long-Term Benefits and Sustainability

Title: Long-Term Impact and Future Potential

Bullet Points:

Year-on-Year Savings: Continuous cost reductions through reduced TMX API usage.

Sustainability: Improved operational efficiency and resource optimization for long-term benefits.

Scalability: Potential to extend the solution to other APIs and environments.

Contract Negotiations: The system’s success provides leverage in renegotiating vendor contracts for further savings.




---

Slide 9: Conclusion

Title: Conclusion & Key Takeaways

Bullet Points:

Success Through Ownership: The implementation of the TMX API Mocking System exemplifies ownership and proactive execution.

Collaboration in Action: Achieved by working as one cohesive team, driving timely and impactful results.

Key Impact: Delivered a critical solution ahead of schedule, ensuring long-term cost savings, contract compliance, and operational efficiency.
